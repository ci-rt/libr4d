Description: Linutronix Testrack Helper Library (development files)
 Remote For Device-under-test (R4D) Daemon acts as controlling server for test

 A rack can host several DUTs (device-under-test).
 R4D connects to the serial device server and the power switch to perform
 actions on user requests. A user connects to r4d through a SOAP interface.
